                <h3>Rebates</h3>

                <p>In order to qualify for a Rebate, you must: (i) be signed up for a Influencer Pulse account. You can set
                    up your account here
                    and (ii) complete a purchase using the
                    URL provided from the Site (“Qualified Purchase”). If you complete your purchase through another URL
                    not associated through the Site, you may not be eligible to receive the Rebate. Once your
                    information is received, your Rebate will be reviewed and approved by the Seller in their sole
                    discretion. Influencer Pulse is not responsible for any unapproved Rebates. In addition, if you return the
                    item subject to the Rebate, you forfeit your right to the Rebate and the amount will be deducted
                    from your account.</p>

                <h3>Buyer Rebate Payment Requirements</h3>

                <p>As a condition of payment of applicable Rebates, you must establish and maintain an account with
                    the information necessary to process your payment: your first and last name, a valid email address
                    at which you are able to receive email, a valid postal address at which you are able to receive
                    mail, and a password to protect your account. You further agree to provide additional information
                    we may reasonably request to verify your identity as a condition for receiving payment.</p>

                <p>As a condition of payment of applicable Rebates, you agree not to resell any products you purchased
                    in connection with the Site. If you resell any products we reserve the right to cancel the Rebates
                    and your account. You further agree not have more than one account per household. You agree not to
                    claim more than one Rebate per unique product in connection with the Site. You further agree not to
                    apply any additional promotional coupons or discounts when you claim Rebates in connection with the
                    Site.</p>

                <p>Influencer Pulse and its designees shall have the right to remove any Buyer Content, as determined in
                    their sole discretion.</p>

                <p>We pay Rebates to Buyer in U.S. dollars via check which will be sent to the address provided in your
                    account. Other payment options may be made available in the future. Rebates are paid to you as the
                    payout date comes, weekly or monthly.
                    We reserve the right to modify the payment schedule at any
                    time. It is your responsibility to keep your address in your account up to date. We are not
                    responsible for payments delivered to the wrong address. If your check expires without being cashed
                    or deposited, or if it is returned uncashed to Influencer Pulse, we will return the amount to your
                    Account, however, it will be subject to a returned check fee in the amount of $5 which will be
                    deducted automatically from your account.</p>

                <p>The determination of a Rebate dispute should be based on the compliance of one or more of the
                    following reasons:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The Influencer Pulse submitted was not legitimate.</li>
                    <li>The order was cancelled or refunded.</li>
                    <li>The product was returned.</li>
                    <li>Extra discount coupons or codes were used along with the Influencer Pulse offer.</li>
                    <li>The item bought was not the one advertised on the site.</li>
                    <li>The item has been bought multiple times from a same account on the marketplace, in connection
                        with the site (this depends on the seller policies).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Any other reasons may be added at the sole discretion of Influencer Pulse. It is your responsibility
                    to check your account regularly to ensure that your Rebates are accurately reflected and that your
                    account balance is accurate. If you believe that a Rebate has not been correctly added to your
                    account, you must contact Influencer Pulse Customer Service atwithin sixty (60) days
                    of the transaction. Should you disagree with any adjustments made to your account or payments made
                    to you, your sole remedy is to cancel your account and cease using our Services. You will be solely
                    responsible for any and all tax liability arising out of any payments you may receive from us.</p>

                <h3>Communications</h3>

                <h3>Seller Store Policies; Rebate Approval; Seller Products</h3>

                <p>A product purchased from any Seller through the Site is governed by and subject to the applicable
                    Seller’s store policies, including applicable exchange and shipping policies. We encourage you to
                    read and understand these policies before making a purchase. You agree that we are not agents of any
                    Seller and that the Sellers operate independently and are not under our control with respect to the
                    Rebates or otherwise. Accordingly, your participation in offers or promotions of, or correspondence
                    with, any Seller is solely between you and that Seller. We do not assume any liability, obligation
                    or responsibility for any part of such correspondence, offer or Rebate, including, without
                    limitation, the withdrawal or modification of any such offer or Rebate.</p>

                <p>All matters concerning the products and services posted from a Seller, including but not limited to
                    purchase terms, payment terms, warranties, guarantees, maintenance and delivery, are solely between
                    you and Seller. Influencer Pulse makes no warranties or representations whatsoever with regard to any
                    goods or services provided by Sellers. You will not consider Influencer Pulse, nor will Influencer Pulse be
                    construed as, a party to such transactions, whether or not Influencer Pulse may have received some form of
                    revenue or other remuneration in connection with the transaction. You agree that Influencer Pulse will not
                    be liable for any costs or damages arising out of such transactions, either directly or indirectly.

                    actions, product or content of all these and any other third parties. If you want to request a
                    refund, you must request the refund directly from the Seller. To the extent that a purchase or a
                    Rebate is cancelled or does not meet your expectations for any reason, you must contact the Seller
                    and your sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the purchase is with the Seller and not with
                    Influencer Pulse. All communications or disputes regarding Rebates or refunds are between the Seller and
                    you. Influencer Pulse will not be responsible or liable in any way for Rebates, refunds, errors in issuing
                    Rebates or refunds or lack of Rebates or refunds. In addition, Influencer Pulse is not responsible for the
                    truth or accuracy of any Seller Content (defined below) or the ability of any Seller complete a
                    transaction. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may report the misconduct of any Seller and/or third
                    parties in connection with the Site or any Services to us, and we, in our sole discretion, may
                    investigate the claim and take action.</p>

                <h3>Indemnification</h3>

                <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold Influencer Pulse and its affiliates, licensors, suppliers,
                    advertisers and sponsors, and their respective directors, officers, employees, consultants, agents
                    and other representatives, harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, costs
                    (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) and other expenses that arise directly or indirectly out of
                    or from (a) your breach of these Terms of Use; (b) any allegation that any Seller Content or other

                    activities in connection with the Site; and/or (d) termination of your access to the Site.</p>

                <h3>Ownership</h3>

                <p>All right, title, and interest in the Site and the Services belong solely to Influencer Pulse or its
                    licensors. Additionally, Influencer Pulse shall maintain all right, title, and interest in “Influencer Pulse”
                    and any other marks, service marks, trademarks, or logos of Influencer Pulse (collectively, the “Marks”)
                    that are registered in the U.S. and other countries. The Marks owned by Influencer Pulse, whether
                    registered or unregistered, may not be used in connection with any product or service that is not
                    offered by Influencer Pulse, in any manner that is likely to cause confusion with customers, or in any
                    manner that disparages Influencer Pulse. Nothing contained on the Site should be construed as granting, by
                    implication, estoppel or otherwise, any license or right to use any Mark without the express written
                    permission of Influencer Pulse, Influencer Pulse’s licensors or suppliers, or the third-party owner of any such
                    Mark. Misuse of any Marks is prohibited, and Influencer Pulse will aggressively enforce its intellectual
                    property rights in such Marks, including via civil and criminal proceedings. You shall not mention
                    or use Influencer Pulse in any ad text, extensions or banner ads without the express written consent of
                    Influencer Pulse.</p>


                <h3>Governing Law; Dispute Resolution</h3>

                <p>The validity, construction, and interpretation of this Agreement, and the rights and duties of the
                    parties hereto, will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
                    Wyoming in the United States, without regard to conflicts of law provisions contained there.
                    You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or in connection with Influencer Pulse’s
                    business, the Services or this Agreement or relating in any way to the Site shall be determined by
                    binding arbitration. You further agree that the U.S. Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration
                    law shall govern the interpretation and enforcement of this agreement to arbitrate. You also agree
                    to waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action. These waivers are mutual
                    as between you and Influencer Pulse, and Influencer Pulse waives its right to a trial by jury or to participate
                    in a class action against you. This means that neither you nor Influencer Pulse can seek to assert class
                    or representative claims against each other either in court or in arbitration and no relief can be
                    awarded on a class or representative basis. The arbitrator also may not consolidate or join another
                    person’s claim with your claim or issue an order that would achieve the same result. You and Rebate
                    Key further agree that if the provisions of this paragraph are found to be unenforceable, then the
                    entire provision compelling arbitration shall be null and void. You also agree that all issues are
                    for the arbitrator to decide. This includes all issues related to the scope, application,
                    interpretation and enforceability of this Agreement and this arbitration provision. The arbitrator
                    shall also decide whether any claim is subject to arbitration. The arbitration will be governed by
                    the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”),
                    as modified by this Agreement, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available
                    online at www.adr.com. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Agreement. If your claim in
                    arbitration is for less than $50,000, Influencer Pulse will reimburse you for filing and arbitrator fees
                    at the conclusion of the proceeding unless your claim is found to be frivolous by the arbitrator. In
                    lieu of arbitration, you may also elect to have your claims decided in small-claims court, so long
                    as the small-claims court does not permit class, representative, or consolidated actions, or the
                    award of relief in favor of any person or entity that is not a named party to the small-claims
                    action.</p>

                <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>

                <p>You may not assign your rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, without
                    our prior written consent, and any such assignment without such consent will be null and void.
                    Headings under this Agreement intended only for convenience and shall not affect the interpretation
                    of this Agreement. Any waiver or failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement on one occasion
                    will not be deemed a waiver of any other provision or of such provision on any other occasion. If
                    any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the
                    remaining provisions. This Agreement represents the entire agreement of the parties with respect to
                    the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements or
                    representations, written or oral (including without limitation, earlier versions of this Agreement
                    that may have been accepted by you).</p>
